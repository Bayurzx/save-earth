This app was designed for the explorers, adventurers of the world. It is a way for you to feature something weird you saw from any where on earth and save it. Hence, Save-Earth get it... 😁😓😓.

The main object of this project is to create awareness for endangered life on earth, It creates an avenue to showcase your discovery but adding a bit of spotlight to it.

It could either become a social app for the beauty of life on earth or a register for data scientist, researchers, NGO etc...

The app is still in the early stages and I have so much ideas for improvement, such getting live reading on animals with wearables, creating datasets for research, providing data for engineers working on animal robotics etc...
